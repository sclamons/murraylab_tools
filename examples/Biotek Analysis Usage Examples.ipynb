    "The Biotek package of `murraylab_tools` is designed to make your life easier when analyzing Biotek time series data. Specifically, murraylab_tools.Biotek converts Biotek data to tidy format for easy analysis with Pandas and easy plotting with Seaborn. The package also contains a few convenience functions for some of the things you're likely to do with TX-TL time series data, currently including:\n",
