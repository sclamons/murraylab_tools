Be careful with this information -- hard-coding a username and password into a notebook that you might share is a good way to leak private information. You may wish to have your program read username and password information from another source (such as a file or the command line). Even better, you can create a separate email account for automated notifications, so that your program never has access to your \"real\" credentials.\n",

To do this, it will need to log into an email account, for which you must provide a username and password. It will also need to know where you want your alerts sent. This is done with the `set_credentials` and `set_destionation` functions. You only need to run these functions once per script.\n",
