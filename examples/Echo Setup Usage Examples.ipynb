    "The \"echo\" subpackage of murraylab_tools is designed to automate the setup of reactions (mostly TX-TL reactions) with the Echo. The EchoRun class can produce picklists for the Echo, as well as instructions for loading a source plate to go with those instructions, when appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently three main modes of operations of the Echo package, distinguished mainly by their inputs:\n",
    "- **TX-TL Setup Spreadsheet**: Takes a pair of CSV spreadsheets saved from a TX-TL setup spreadsheet (version 2.X). Use this for most TX-TL experiments. \n",
    "- **2D Dilution Series in TX-TL**: Takes a Python description of two materials and their dilutions. Use this when you want to run one or more two-way dilution series in TX-TL, for instance when calibrating Mg and K salts. \n",
    "- **Association Spreadsheet**: Takes one or more spreadsheets describing the contents of an Echo source plate, plus a simple spreadsheet describing final concentrations of the materials of those source plates in each destination. Use this for non-TX-TL experiments, or if you have a TX-TL experiment with more source materials than can be handled in a TX-TL setup spreadsheet."

    "*A word of warning*: The quick start examples will help you jump right into setting up an experiment, but they make a number of assumptions about your experiment. Some things you'll want to check before running your own:\n",
    "- **Reaction Size**: Default is 5 µL.\n",
    "- **Buffer/Extract Fractions**: Default is 0.24/0.51 (typical for French Press extracts).\n",
    "- **Source Plate Type**: Default is 384_PP. You probably want this.\n",
    "- **Source Plate Material**: Default is AQ_BP (buffer-like liquids).\n",
    "- **Destination Plate Type**: Default is generic 384 well.\n",
    "- **Controls**: TX-TL experiments come with a negative control. Most TX-TL setup spreadsheets also define a positive control.\n",
    "- **Dead Volume/Max Volume**: Default dead volume is 20 µL, including loss to meniscus. Default max volume is 65 µL.\n",
    "- **Volume/Aliquot of Buffer and Extract**: Default is 30 µL extract/aliquot and 37 µL buffer/aliquot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, be aware that the TX-TL setup scripts keep track of which source plate wells they've used in a .dat file. If you run those experiments repeatedly, they'll fill up the file and eventually error out when they run out of wells on the plate. \n",
