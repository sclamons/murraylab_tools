    "The \"echo\" subpackage of murraylab_tools is designed to automate the setup of reactions (mostly TX-TL reactions) with the Echo. The EchoRun class can produce picklists for the Echo, as well as instructions for loading a source plate to go with those instructions, when appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently three main modes of operations of the Echo package, distinguished mainly by their inputs:\n",
    "- **TX-TL Setup Spreadsheet**: Takes a pair of CSV spreadsheets saved from a TX-TL setup spreadsheet (version 2.X). Use this for most TX-TL experiments. \n",
    "- **Programmatic Setup**: You can build a TX-TL reaction (or, with a bit more difficulty, a non-TX-TL reaction) programmatically, without using a setup spreadsheet. There are a couple of functions for doing this, which can be combined:\n",
    "    - **build_dilution_series**: Takes two materials and an array of concentrations for each, and builds a 2D dilution series out of the two. Can also be used to set up 1D dilution series (by setting one of the materials to a dummy material and giving it the concentration list [0]). \n",
    "    - **add_material_to_block**: Adds a single ingredient to all wells in a rectangular block on the destination plate, at a fixed concentration.\n",
    "    - **add_material_to_well**: Like add_material_to_block, but to a single well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Association Spreadsheet**: Takes one or more spreadsheets describing the contents of an Echo source plate, plus a simple spreadsheet describing final concentrations of the materials of those source plates in each destination. Use this for non-TX-TL experiments, or if you have a TX-TL experiment with more source materials than can be handled in a TX-TL setup spreadsheet."

    "*A word of warning*: The quick start examples will help you jump right into setting up an experiment, but they make a number of assumptions about your experiment. Some things you'll want to check before running your own:\n",

    "- **Buffer/Extract Fractions**: Defaults are 0.42/0.33 (typical for French Press extracts).\n",

    "- **Source Plate Material**: Default is AQ_BP (buffer-like liquids).\n",
    "- **Destination Plate Type**: Default is \"Nunc_384_black_glassbottom\".\n",
    "- **Destination Plate Size**: The Echo package has no knowledge of the destination plate. *There is no check to keep you from defining picks off the edge of the destination plate*.\n",
    "- **Controls**: TX-TL experiments come with a negative control. Most TX-TL setup spreadsheets also define a positive control.\n",
    "- **Dead Volume/Max Volume**: Default dead volume is 21 µL, including loss to meniscus. Default max volume is 65 µL. \n",

    "Every project begins with an EchoRun object. This object holds (nearly) all of the information about an experiment, and is ultimately responsible for coordinating plates and materials, and for actually writing picklists and experimental protocols. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most EchoRun objects need a SourcePlate object. This object is responsible for keeping track of which wells have been used, and for assigning new wells on the source plate to materials that you'll want to transfer. It will try to assign wells in a way that keeps the same material in a contiguous block, buffered on either side by an empty well for ease of pipetting. SourcePlate objects are also typically associated with a .dat tracking file that lists which wells have been used on the plate. That way, you can use the same source plate over many experiments without having to manually program in which wells are forbidden. The SourcePlate object will read this file to learn what it has available to it, and will automatically write back to the same file whenever the EchoRun object controlling it writes a picklist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Materials (DNA, chemicals, water, TX-TL, etc) on a source plate are represented by EchoSourceMaterial objects. An EchoSourceMaterial has a concentration, which is always stored in nM. However, because dsDNA is usually measured in ng/uL, and dsDNA is one of the most common materials used, EchoSourceMaterials by default assume that the concentration set in their constructors is in units of ng/uL. Any EchoSourceMaterial with `length` > 0 will convert that ng/uL concentration into an internal nM concentration. Only if the length of the EchoSourceMaterial is set to 0 will it use its set concentration value directly. This convention appears in several other contexts in the echo package.\n",
    "\n",
    "An EchoSourceMaterial is always associated with a SourcePlate. The EchoSourceMaterial keeps track of how much of itself has been used, and will request that wells be allocated on the SourcePlate. \n",
    "\n",
    "EchoRun objects can also have a MasterMix object, which defines what materials will be put into the master mix, and at what concentrations. Association lists don't currently support master mixes, and TX-TL reactions built from CSVs will always pull their master mix information from the CSV, so this is currently only useful if you're using the dilution series function(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate an Echo picklist, you will generally need to do three things:\n",
    "- Building an EchoRun object. This usually just means setting the name of a source plate tracking file\n",
    "- Describe the experiment. This almost always means one or more calls to `build_picklist_from_txtl_setup_csvs`, `build_dilution_series`, or `build_picklist_from_association_spreadsheet` from your EchoRun object. What this entails depends on your experiment; TX-TL setup with a setup spreadsheet and association file setups are almost completely defined by external files, while 2D dilution series experiments require some definition in your script. \n",
    "- Write the picklist, which is done with a call to `write_picklist` from your EchoRun object. \n",

If you absolutely must squeeze every last bit of efficiency out of your source wells (or if you want to use a low-dead-volume plate), you can set the `dead_volume` and `max_volume` variables, which are static variables in the murraylab_tools.echo package. If you change them, also make sure to set the static variable `usable_volume`, which defines the volume of material in a well that can actually be used by the Echo (this is normally calculated from `dead_volume` and `max_volume` at package import). Also, you should do this before running any experimental protocol function."
